What is a nested loop?

Which kind of loop is based on a conditional statement: while loops or for loops?

- A nested loop is a loop that occurs within another loop, structurally similar to nested if â€¨statements. The program first encounters the outer loop, executing its first iteration. This first iteration triggers the inner, nested loop, which then runs to completion. Then the program returns back to the top of the outer loop, completing the second iteration and again triggering the nested loop. Again, the nested loop runs to completion, and the program returns back to the top of the outer loop until the sequence is complete or a break or other statement disrupts the process.

When you want to iterate a specific number of times, would you typically use a while loop or a for loop?

- range() is used to control how many times the loop will be repeated.

Is it possible to loop through a string one letter at a time? What is the example given in the article?

- 
Extrapolate from what you learned in the articles: Do you think a for loop be nested inside a while loop? Why or why not?

- Yes. You can use one or more loop inside any another while, for or do..while loop.
